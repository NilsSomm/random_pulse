# random_pulse
## Introduction
This code uses the PCM (Partial Coherence Model) to simulate SASE (Self-Amplifed Spontaneous Emmission) FEL (Free-Electron Laser) pulses. These types of pulses form from random noise, so this is a stochastic process. The PCM method then makes use of random number generation to model this, and can be read about more Here: (T. Pfeifer et al., 2010), T. Pfeifer et al., Optics Letters 35, 3441, (2010).
## Overview
There are 2 included python classes in this repository. The first is the random_laser_pulse
